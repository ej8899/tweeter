## Detailed Operation...  
- Start your tweeter server from the command line with ```npm start```
- Once that is running (it responds only with "Example app listening on port 8080), you can open a web browser window to ```localhost:8080``` to get started with Tweeter!

- From the main window, you can experiment with a few built in sample tweets, or start creating your own by clicking the double down chevrons in the top right to open the tweet message form.  We've incorporated extra features such as "like", "retweet" and "report" this tweet, along with tweet generators from the ICanHazDadJoke API and just a few random ones in our built in database.

- Clicking the smiley face icon gets you a "Dad Joke", while the shuffle arrows pull a random quote from our internal database.  The numbers represent the characters remaining in your tweet message.

- A tweet must be less than 140 characters, and of course, greater than zero characters!

- If "liking" tweets, you can quickly view your favorites, by clicking the heart icon under your avatar image.  Click it again to return to the view of all tweets.

- We've determined that 10 tweets loaded at a time is plenty.  So if you've got more, scroll down and click the "more" link.  A badge icon shows you how many more older tweets remain to be viewed.

- Tweeter is also built to support both 'desktop' and 'mobile' devices.  Down scaling your window will cause Tweeter to adjust for a more suitable display.

## Known Bugs...
- Return from liked tweets only" results in all tweets shown - pagination system breaks after this switch.
- V. scroll bar is forced 'always' on' to prevent page shift if only a few tweets on page.
